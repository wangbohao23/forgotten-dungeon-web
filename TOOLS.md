# TOOLS.md - Local Notes

Skills define *how* tools work. This file is for *your* specifics — the stuff that's unique to your setup.

## What Goes Here

Things like:
- Camera names and locations
- SSH hosts and aliases  
- Preferred voices for TTS
- Speaker/room names
- Device nicknames
- Anything environment-specific

## Examples

```markdown
### Cameras
- living-room → Main area, 180° wide angle
- front-door → Entrance, motion-triggered

### SSH
- home-server → 192.168.1.100, user: admin

### TTS
- Preferred voice: "Meijia" (中文播报)
- Auto-speak: 当用户消息以 "say" 开头时，自动用系统语音播报
```

## Why Separate?

Skills are shared. Your setup is yours. Keeping them apart means you can update skills without losing your notes, and share skills without leaking your infrastructure.
